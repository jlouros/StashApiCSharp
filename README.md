// Stash client connection using basic authentication
var client = new StashClient("http://your_stash_server_url:7990/", "username", "password");

// Gets a list of projects (by default a maximum of 25 results will be return)
// we recommend use of async/await instead of forcing synchronous execution
var projects = client.Projects.Get().Result;

// Gets a list of repositories from project "PROJKEY" (by default a maximum of 25 results will be return)
// using async
var repositories = await client.Repositories.Get("PROJKEY");
